# Studying Web Development

Follow my journey of studying web development in Germany.  
This repository contains projects and exercises I completed as part of my studies.  
All work here is created by me and serves as a way to document my learning progress.

## Check it out

Simply clone the directories and files using Git’s built-in cloning tool:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Maretyui/study.git
```

## Usage

After downloading all files, start the project either by opening the `index.html` file in your browser,  
or by starting **Live Server** in the root directory (recommended for faster development and live reload).

## Structure

The repository is organized by assignment IDs. Typically, each folder is named after the assignment and contains the website’s source code.

## Contributing

Pull requests are *not* welcome at the moment.  
If you feel there is an urgent need for change, please open an issue first.

## Disclaimer

I am not allowed to upload the official assignments, as they are copyright-protected.  
All you will see here are the results I created myself and submitted.
